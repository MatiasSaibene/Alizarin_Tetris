***Alizarin Tetris***
			      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			  Version 1.1.0 - "Renovatio"

This is a Linux version of the classic Tetris game, but with a twist
related to gravity and block colors. Getting it to run on your system is a easy task:

 - Just run the compile_CMake.sh script, also remember to copy the Docs,
   graphics and styles folders to the build folder. Change to the build
   directory and run the atris executable.

The "Renovatio" edition is the first with changes since 2005. I simply took the source code and repaired it as much as possible so that it could be recompiled on a modern Linux system using CMake.  Additionally I changed the font from NewMediumSans to DejaVuBoldOblique and added a new piece style (Glow.color).
